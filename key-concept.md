# Key Concepts in Perceptual Psychology

This document aggregates key concepts and definitions from the weekly course materials.

## Week 01: Introduction to Perception
**Topic:** The Architecture of Experience

*   **Perception:** The active process by which the brain selects, organizes, and interprets sensory information to construct a meaningful representation of the world. It is not merely a passive recording of reality.
*   **Sensation:** The initial process of detecting physical energy (light, sound, heat) from the environment and converting it into neural signals.
*   **Psychophysics:** The scientific study of the relationship between physical stimuli (e.g., light intensity) and the psychological sensations/perceptions they evoke (e.g., brightness).
*   **The Inverse Problem:** The fundamental challenge in vision where a 2D retinal image could be caused by infinite 3D sources, requiring the brain to make probabilistic inferences to reconstruct the scene.

## Week 02: Basic Principles of Sensory Physiology
**Topic:** From Sparks to Perception

*   **Transduction:** The process by which specialized sensory receptors convert physical energy (like photons or sound waves) into electrochemical neural signals (action potentials).
*   **Action Potential:** The rapid rise and fall in voltage across a cellular membrane ("spike") that neurons use to transmit information over long distances.
*   **Neural Coding:** The way the brain interprets patterns of neural activity to represent specific sensory qualities (e.g., rate coding for intensity, place coding for pitch).
*   **Müller's Law of Specific Nerve Energies:** The principle that the nature of perception is defined by the pathway over which the sensory information is carried (e.g., stimulating the optic nerve is always perceived as light, even if done mechanically).

## Week 03: The Eye and Retina
**Topic:** From Photon to Perception

*   **Photoreceptors:** Specialized cells in the retina (Rods and Cones) that absorb light and initiate visual transduction.
    *   **Rods:** Highly sensitive to light, responsible for scotopic (night) vision and peripheral motion, but colorblind.
    *   **Cones:** Less sensitive, responsible for photopic (day) vision, high acuity (fovea), and color perception.
*   **Receptive Field:** The specific region of sensory space (e.g., area of the retina) in which a stimulus will trigger the firing of a particular neuron.
*   **Lateral Inhibition:** The capacity of an excited neuron to reduce the activity of its neighbors, enhancing edge detection and contrast perception (e.g., Mach bands).
*   **Blind Spot:** The area on the retina where the optic nerve exits the eye, lacking photoreceptors; the brain "fills in" this gap with surrounding visual information.

## Week 04: The Visual Cortex and Beyond
**Topic:** From Retina to Reality & The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat

*   **Primary Visual Cortex (V1):** The first cortical area to receive visual input, containing a retinotopic map and neurons specialized for detecting oriented edges (simple cells).
*   **Visual Agnosia:** An impairment in recognizing visually presented objects, despite intact visual acuity.
    *   **The Glove Problem (Dr. P):** A case study by Oliver Sacks where a patient could describe the geometric features of a glove ("continuous surface enfolded on itself") but could not identify it as a glove, illustrating the separation of "seeing" (sensation) from "meaning" (perception).
*   **Prosopagnosia (Face Blindness):** A specific form of agnosia characterized by the inability to recognize faces, even of familiar people or oneself, often due to damage in the fusiform gyrus.
*   **The Astonishing Hypothesis (Crick):** The proposal that all human thoughts, feelings, and consciousness are entirely the result of the electrochemical activity of nerve cells (neurons) in the brain.

## Week 05: Perceiving Objects and Scenes
**Topic:** The Architecture of Reality & The Island of the Colorblind

*   **Achromatopsia:** A condition characterized by a partial or total absence of color vision.
    *   **Congenital Achromatopsia (Pingelap):** A rare genetic disorder (studied by Sacks) resulting in total color blindness, extreme light sensitivity (photophobia), and low visual acuity, forcing reliance on rod vision ("The Night Vision Secret").
*   **Monochromatic Vision:** Seeing the world only in shades of gray (values of brightness), similar to black-and-white film, often described by patients as a world of "texture" and "contrast" rather than color.
*   **Rod Monochromacy:** A form of color blindness where cones are non-functional, leading to a "night-vision" dominance even in daylight, requiring sunglasses to prevent rod saturation.

## Week 06: Perceiving Objects and Scenes (Cont)
**Topic:** Hubel's Eye, Brain, and Vision

*   **Feature Detectors:** Neurons in the visual cortex that respond selectively to specific features of a stimulus, such as orientation, motion, or length.
    *   **Simple Cells:** Neurons in V1 that respond best to a bar of light with a specific orientation in a specific location.
    *   **Complex Cells:** Neurons that respond to an oriented bar anywhere within their receptive field, often preferring movement.
*   **Critical Period:** A specific window of time in early development during which the brain is highly plastic and requires specific sensory input (e.g., seeing lines) to develop normal cortical architecture.
*   **Hierarchical Processing:** The theory that the visual system builds complex representations (faces, objects) by combining simple features (lines, edges) in successive stages (V1 -> V2 -> V4 -> IT).

## Week 07: Visual Attention
**Topic:** The Cognitive Spotlight & Neuroaesthetics

*   **Visual Attention:** The cognitive process of selectively concentrating on one aspect of the environment while ignoring others ("The Cognitive Spotlight").
*   **Gestalt Psychology:** A school of thought emphasizing that "the whole is greater than the sum of its parts" and that the brain organizes sensory input into coherent "wholes" (Gestalts) based on specific laws.
    *   **Law of Similarity:** We tend to group elements that look similar (e.g., by color or shape) as part of the same object or pattern.
    *   **Law of Good Figure (Pragnanz):** We tend to see the simplest, most stable, and most regular interpretation of a stimulus.
*   **Neuroaesthetics (Semir Zeki):** The scientific study of the neural bases for the contemplation and creation of a work of art, proposing that "great art" resonates with the specific functional organization of the visual brain.

## Week 08: Midterm Exam
*(No new concepts introduced)*

## Week 09: Taking Action
**Topic:** Gestalt Principles and Illusion Demonstrations

*   **Figure-Ground Organization:** The perceptual tendency to separate a visual scene into a central figure (the "main character") and a background, which can be bistable (e.g., Face-Vase illusion).
*   **Illusory Contours (Kanizsa Triangle):** The perception of edges or shapes that do not physically exist in the stimulus, created by the brain's tendency to complete implied forms and "explain" gaps (The Phantom Triangle).
*   **Impossible Objects:** 2D drawings (like the Devil's Tuning Fork) that represent 3D objects that cannot exist in physical reality, creating a conflict between local and global perceptual rules.
*   **Constructive Perception:** The concept that what we perceive is a construction of the brain based on sensory input and internal assumptions/rules, demonstrated by how illusions "trick" these rules.

## Week 10: Perceiving Motion
**Topic:** Focus & Visual Search

*   **Inattentional Blindness:** The failure to notice a fully-visible, but unexpected object because attention was engaged on another task (e.g., "The Invisible Gorilla" experiment).
*   **Visual Search:** The task of looking for a target in a display containing distracting elements.
    *   **Feature Search:** Searching for a target defined by a single unique attribute (e.g., red among green). Fast and "pop-out" (parallel processing).
    *   **Conjunction Search:** Searching for a target defined by a combination of two or more features (e.g., "Where's Waldo" - red AND striped). Slow and effortful (serial processing).
*   **The Binding Problem:** The question of how the brain combines different features (color, shape, motion) processed in different brain areas into a single, unified object perception.
*   **Flow (Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi):** A mental state of operation in which a person performing an activity is fully immersed in a feeling of energized focus, full involvement, and enjoyment.

## Week 11: Perceiving Color
**Topic:** The Mirror Neuron System & Affordances

*   **Mirror Neurons:** A class of neurons (originally found in F5 of macaques) that fire both when an individual performs an action and when they observe the same action performed by another ("Monkey See, Monkey Do"). They are thought to be the neural basis for empathy and action understanding.
*   **Affordances (J.J. Gibson):** The quality of an object or environment that allows an individual to perform an action (e.g., a chair "affords" sitting, a handle "affords" pulling). We perceive objects in terms of what we can *do* with them.
*   **Action Understanding:** The ability to interpret the goal or intention of another's movement by mapping it onto one's own motor representation.

## Week 12: Perceiving Depth and Size
**Topic:** Neural Portrait & Motion Illusions

*   **Functional Specialization:** The principle that different areas of the brain are specialized for different functions (modules).
    *   **Fusiform Face Area (FFA):** A region in the fusiform gyrus specialized for face perception (Nancy Kanwisher's "Face Place").
    *   **Parahippocampal Place Area (PPA):** A region specialized for perceiving scenes and places.
*   **Motion Aftereffect (Waterfall Illusion):** An illusion where, after staring at continuous motion in one direction, a stationary object appears to move in the opposite direction. Caused by the neural fatigue (adaptation) of motion-selective neurons.
*   **Motion Blindness (Akinetopsia):** A rare neuropsychological disorder in which a patient cannot perceive motion in their visual field, seeing the world as a series of frozen snapshots (often due to damage in area V5/MT).

## Week 13: Hearing: Physiology and Perception
**Topic:** An Anthropologist on Mars & Color Deficiency

*   **Cerebral Achromatopsia (Acquired):** Loss of color vision due to brain damage (specifically in area V4), as described in "The Case of the Colorblind Painter." The patient loses not just color perception but color *memory* and *imagery*.
*   **Qualia:** The subjective, individual quality of a conscious experience (e.g., the "redness" of red). "Is my red your red?"
*   **Synesthesia:** A perceptual phenomenon in which stimulation of one sensory or cognitive pathway leads to automatic, involuntary experiences in a second pathway (e.g., seeing colors when hearing music).

## Week 14: Hearing in the Environment
**Topic:** Stereograms & Size Constancy

*   **Stereopsis:** Depth perception derived from the binocular disparity (difference) between the images seen by the left and right eyes.
*   **Random Dot Stereograms (Bela Julesz):** Images composed of random dots that contain no monocular depth cues but reveal a 3D shape when fused binocularly, proving that disparity alone is sufficient for depth perception ("Magic Eye").
*   **Size Constancy:** The perception of an object as having a fixed size, despite the changing size of its image on the retina as distance changes.
*   **Size-Distance Scaling:** The mechanism (Emmert's Law) where the brain uses perceived distance to scale the retinal image size: $S = K(R \times D)$ (Perceived Size = Constant $\times$ Retinal Size $\times$ Distance).
*   **Echolocation:** The use of reflected sound waves to determine the location of objects in space, used by bats and some blind humans to navigate.

## Week 15: Perceiving Music & Speech
**Topic:** The Decoders Journey

*   **Auditory Scene Analysis:** The process by which the auditory system separates the complex mixture of sounds reaching the ears into individual sources or "streams" (e.g., separating a voice from background noise).
*   **Phonemic Restoration Effect:** A perceptual phenomenon where a missing phoneme in a word (replaced by a noise like a cough) is "filled in" by the brain based on context, so the listener perceives the word as intact.
*   **McGurk Effect:** An audiovisual illusion that demonstrates the interaction between hearing and vision in speech perception (seeing "ga" while hearing "ba" creates perception of "da").
*   **Prosody:** The rhythm, stress, and intonation of speech ("musicality of speech") that conveys emotional tone and meaning beyond the literal words.
