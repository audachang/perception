# Stereograms & Size Constancy

**Introduction:**   


This presentation examines Bela Julesz's pioneering work on cyclopean perception using random-dot stereograms and the classic psychophysics of size constancy.

**Brainstorming Questions:**
1. **Magic Eye Pictures:**
   Explain Random Dot Stereograms (Julesz). Explain, as if you were talking to, your aunt how a mess of static snow can turn into a 3D dinosaur. It's because our brain compares the tiny shift (disparity) between the left and right eye images to calculate depth mathematically, even without any outlines or recognizable shapes.

2. **The Tiny Car Trick:**
   Look at a car far away; it looks toy-sized on your retina. Explain, as if you were talking to, a 5-year-old why they know it's a real big car and not a toy. Tell them their brain does math (Size-Distance Scaling) automatically: "It looks small, but it's far away, so it must be HUGE!"

3. **Echolocation:**
   Some blind people can "see" with sound (like bats). Explain, as if you were talking to, your friend how reflected sound waves can create a "spatial map" in the brain, utilizing the same areas that usually process vision to navigate the environment.
