# Stereograms & Size Constancy

**Introduction:**   


This presentation examines Bela Julesz's pioneering work on cyclopean perception using random-dot stereograms and the classic psychophysics of size constancy.

**Brainstorming Questions:**

1. **The Coughing Radio:**
   Have someone cough loudly while you are saying a sentence. Did the listener hear the missing word anyway? Explain, as if you were talking to, your grandma that her brain is a "polite editor" (Phonemic Restoration) that fills in missing sounds so smoothly she doesn't even notice the gaps, just like autocorrect for her ears.

2. **The Soldier vs. The Crowd:**
   Listen to a random clatter vs. a drum beat. Why is one noise and the other music? Explain, as if you were talking to, a child that music is "organized sound" that our brain likes to predict. Use an analogy of marching soldiers (music) coming down the street vs. a disorganized crowd of people (noise) bumping into each other.

3. **The Party Challenge:**
   Put on earmuffs and try to listen to one person talking at a loud party. Exhausting, right? Explain, as if you were talking to, your grandfather why hearing loss makes him so tired. Tell him his brain has to work out like a bodybuilder just to separate the "voice" from the "noise" without the clear signal, which consumes all his energy.
