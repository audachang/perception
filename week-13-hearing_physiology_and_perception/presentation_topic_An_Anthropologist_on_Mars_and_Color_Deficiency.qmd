# An Anthropologist on Mars & Color Deficiency

**Introduction:**

This session discusses Oliver Sacks' case studies (such as "The Case of the Colorblind Painter") on living with acquired perceptual disorders, alongside a deeper look at the mechanisms and lived experiences of color deficiency.

**Brainstorming Questions:**

1. **Losing the Rainbow:**
   Imagine suddenly losing the ability to see color after an accident. Explain, as if you were talking to, your grandfather why food might look "disgusting" (like grey goo) even if it tastes fine, because our brain uses color to tell us if food is fresh or safe.

2. **The " Martian" View:**
   Dr. Sacks described feeling like an "anthropologist on Mars" when trying to understand autistic perception. Explain, as if you were talking to, your grandma how some people's brains process social signals differently, just like someone from another planet trying to learn our customs by watching carefully.

3. **Is My Red Your Red?:**
   If you and your friend both point to a strawberry and say "Red," do you see the same thing? Explain, as if you were talking to, a 6-year-old that we can never be 100% sure we see the same colors, just like we can't be sure chocolate tastes exactly the same to everyone.
