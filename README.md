## Course Description

How does the brain turn light waves into a recognizable face, air pressure changes into a melody, or chemical molecules into the flavor of a morning coffee? Perception is not merely a passive recording of the world; it is an active construction of reality. This course bridges the gap between sensory physiology and conscious experience.
