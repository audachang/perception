# Focus & Visual Search

**Introduction:**   


This presentation focuses on the mechanisms of attention, drawing from Daniel Goleman's insights on focus and current research on the factors that guide visual search in complex environments.

**Brainstorming Questions:**
1. **The Invisible Gorilla:**
   Explain the famous experiment where people miss a gorilla because they are counting basketball passes. Explain, as if you were talking to, your uncle why he couldn't find his keys even though he looked right at them: "Attention" is like a spotlight—if the mental light isn't on it, it's practically invisible to the conscious mind!

2. **Where's Waldo Champion:**
   Explain, as if you were talking to, a child how to get better at visual search. Tell them their brain needs a "target template" (a picture in their head) to scan the crowd, and it's hard work because the brain has to reject every "non-Waldo" person one by one (Binding Problem).

3. **Flow State:**
   Goleman talks about "Focus." Explain, as if you were talking to, a musician friend what "Flow" is—when your attention is so perfectly locked onto what you are doing that the rest of the world (and even your sense of self) disappears.
